# TestApplication_1
test classes to experiment with learning Visual Studios

contains many failed versions of figuring out how unit tests work in Visual Studios.
these seem to be largely caused by overlooking the "public" keyword on the class attempting to be tested.
working version (after making class public): TestProject_1.Unit.Test.

will continue to use/add to this repo while experimenting with various aspects of the IDE.
